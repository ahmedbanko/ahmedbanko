export const ABOUT_STATEMENT = `Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I share my coding adventures and projects. I’m Ahmed Banko, a software engineer based in London with a knack for problem-solving and a passion for all things tech.\n\nHere, you’ll find a collection of my projects spanning various programming languages and frameworks. From my BSc in Computer Science at Kings College London to my hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks, I’m always eager to learn and adapt to the latest developments in the field.\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you can catch me enjoying some downtime with hobbies like watching football, bowling, or hitting the trails for a hike. Because let’s face it, even passionate coders need a break from the screen now and then.\n\nSo, feel free to take a look around, check out my projects, and drop me a line if you have any questions or just want to chat tech. Thanks for stopping by!`;
